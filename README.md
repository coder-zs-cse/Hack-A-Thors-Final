# Hack-A-Thors 
  Present A Website to solve all your brainstorming doubts with 'Ideas'
  
## Problem Statement:-

Part 1 - Many students who are willing to participate in hackathons despite having the tech stack skills and knowledge of theme/ domain, are unable to bring up innovative project idea topics to solve some problems.

Part 2 - Any student who wants to explore a particular CS domain/ techstack would love to see what latest problems solved/ projects build in this domain by students around the country.

## Inspiration

As avid hackathon attendees, we've noticed that there's always a lot of pressure to come up with clever ideas with the potential to win.Many a times it takes 
a lot of time just to come up with an idea and just as you notice,poof! time is out of your hand.

## Solution:- 

A website which lists out hackathon winning/ starred projects from hackathons happening around the country, month wise. The listing of projects will be done in the following manner:-

-> Top 10 projects - overall In this section, top 10 hackathon winning/starred projects of each month will be listed.

-> Top 10 projects - domain wise In this section, every domain like WD, AD, ML, Blockchain, Web3, etc. will have corresponding top 10 list of hackathon winning/ starred projects, month wise.

-> Top 10 projects - theme wise In this section, every theme like Healthcare, Education, Environment, Finance, etc. will have corresponding top 10 list of hackathon winning/ starred projects, month wise

Every project will have corresponding information:-

->Problem statement of the project

->Solution presented

->Techstacks used in the project

->The card will have url which will direct the interested candidate to the github repo of the hackthon project 

## Challenges I ran into

We fortunately didnt run into many issues but we had to get aquainted with bootstrap css so we could get responsive ui for our websites .

We also had to scrape data from multiple websites, information which we had to verify the with github data which took a lot of time and effort 

We also ran into multiple issue when our endpoints from backend api didnt get synced with frontend points so we had to rebuild our build and redeploy it

As we used python the backend had to be highly accurate thus sometimes there were not outputs syncing with or frontend thus we had to reverify our backend api build

## What we learned

This was our first time using Uipath for webscraping, and we found it to be an essential and natural part of our workflow in order to retrieve winning hackathon ideas from Devpost.

We also had a firsthand experience with Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS library which has very responsive elements so we are interested to use it for our future projects 

We also had our first time experience with building backend api using python and flask, and building a complete database in postgreSQL 

## Built with

  HTML, CSS, flask , python, bootstrap, tailwind, javascript ,PostgreSQL, Docker,PHP

## Deployed with
